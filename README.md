## üîÑ Exchange Integration & API Support

Of course. This is an excellent question that gets to the heart of how advanced Layer 2 technologies interact with the traditional centralized finance (CeFi) world of major exchanges.

Here‚Äôs a detailed description of how a zk-rollup implementation integrates with major cryptocurrency exchanges like Binance, Coinbase, and Kraken for automated trading and portfolio management.

### Core Concept: The Two Worlds
